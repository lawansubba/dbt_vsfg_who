## Visualization for change and the World Health Organization

The World Health Organization (WHO) is spearheading an initiative to address health equity for the nearly 1.3 billion people, or 16% of the global population, who have significant disabilities. Recognizing that individuals with disabilities are entitled to the same health rights as others, the WHO emphasizes the necessity for healthcare systems to be accessible and inclusive. The organization has identified a substantial gap in health equity for people with disabilities, noting that they often experience earlier mortality, poorer health outcomes, and additional daily challenges compared to the general population.

In response, the WHO has published a report detailing 40 actionable strategies for nations to enhance their healthcare systems and reduce health disparities for individuals with disabilities. These measures are designed to ensure that health equity for people with disabilities is prioritized in health initiatives, with a focus on empowerment, involvement, and outcome monitoring.

The WHO calls for collaboration among its Member States, civil society, disability organizations, and health stakeholders to advocate for and implement the report's recommendations. This collaborative effort aims to fulfill Sustainable Development Goals and global health targets by ensuring universal access to health.

Additionally, the WHO is partnering with Viz for Social Good to highlight the importance of digital accessibility, urging the creation of visuals that are both impactful and accessible to all. This project targets a wide audience, including the general public, member states, international donor communities, and academia, with the aim of using data visualization across various platforms to advocate for disability inclusion and health equity.

Participants are encouraged to use open-source tools for their visualizations and to adhere to web accessibility standards to create an inclusive digital environment. The initiative seeks to inspire others through an online visualization gallery that showcases submissions exemplifying well-designed, accessible visualizations. The evaluation of these visualizations will focus on their design, impact, and ability to convey the story effectively, while adhering to universal access and accessibility standards.
